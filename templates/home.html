            <p class="text-home">The API aims to help users find areas in the Community of Madrid that best suit their needs. It uses data from Idealista, the Madrid City Council, and the Community of Madrid to create an attractiveness index based on deviations from the average in the Community. While some variables, like the number of hospitals, are straightforward in their impact on attractiveness, others, like temperature, may vary based on user preferences.</p>
            <p class="text-home">Users can adjust the importance of variables like education, temperature, rainfall, total population, average age, average house size, distance to the center, pensioners, and unemployed people. They can mark a higher importance (10) if they want their area to excel in that variable, a lower importance (0) if they disagree with the criteria, or leave it around half (5) if they are not particularly interested. For example, a low average age is considered better for the area, so marking a 10 indicates a preference for a low average age, marking a 0 indicates a preference for a high average age, and marking a 5 indicates indifference.</p>
